✘ [ERROR] Missing entry-point to Worker script or to assets directory


  If there is code to deploy, you can either:
  - Specify an entry-point to your Worker script via the command line (ex: `pnpm wrangler deploy
  src/index.ts`)
  - Or create a "wrangler.jsonc" file containing:

  ```
  {
    "name": "worker-name",
    "compatibility_date": "2026-01-19",
    "main": "src/index.ts"
  }
  ```


  If are uploading a directory of assets, you can either:
  - Specify the path to the directory of assets via the command line: (ex: `pnpm wrangler deploy
  --assets=./dist`)
  - Or create a "wrangler.jsonc" file containing:

  ```
  {
    "name": "worker-name",
    "compatibility_date": "2026-01-19",
    "assets": {
      "directory": "./dist"
    }
  }
  ```

✔ What do you want to name your project? … skatepark

No compatibility date found Defaulting to today: 2026-01-19

✔ Do you want Wrangler to write a wrangler.json config file to store this configuration?
This will allow you to simply run `wrangler deploy` on future deployments. … yes
Wrote
{
  "name": "skatepark",
  "compatibility_date": "2026-01-19",
  "assets": {
    "directory": "./dist"
  }
}
 to /Users/jldec/astro/skatepark/wrangler.jsonc.
Please run `wrangler deploy` instead of `wrangler deploy ./dist` next time. Wrangler will automatically use the configuration saved to wrangler.jsonc.
